var totalAfterTax = 53.03; // uses camelCase if the variable name is multiple words
var tip = 8; // uses lowercase if the variable name is one word

// QUIZ QUESTION
// Which of these are good variable names?


var thingy = 1;
var count = 1; // Correct
var postLiked = false; //Correct
var firstname = "Richard";

// The variables count and postLiked use lowercase and camelCase appropriately.
// The postLiked variable has a descriptive name about what it represents. The count variable is questionable and would depend on its surrounding context.
// If the count variable was supposed to track the number of items in a catalog, then a more descriptive name like catalogCount might be more appropriate.
//
// As for the other variables, thingy is a vague name that doesn't really describe what 1 is the value for and firstname should be in camelCase.
