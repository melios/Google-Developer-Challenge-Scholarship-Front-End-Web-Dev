// QUIZ QUESTION
// What character will be printed to the JavaScript console after running the following lines of code.

var quote = "Stay awhile and listen!";
console.log(quote[6]);

// Alternatively, you can use the String’s charAt() method to access individual characters. 
// For example, quote.charAt(6) would also return "w". You’ll learn more about methods later in this course.
