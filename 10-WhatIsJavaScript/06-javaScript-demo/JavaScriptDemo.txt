Styling elements on the page is great, but you could also do that by just modifying the CSS.
What makes JavaScript so special in this case? Refresh the page, then paste this line of code in the JavaScript console.

document.body.addEventListener('click', function () {
     var myParent = document.getElementById("Banner");
     var myImage = document.createElement("img");
     myImage.src = 'https://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src&type=gif';
     myParent.appendChild(myImage);
     myImage.style.marginLeft = "160px";
});
If you’re confused because nothing happened. Don’t worry. Click somewhere on the page.
