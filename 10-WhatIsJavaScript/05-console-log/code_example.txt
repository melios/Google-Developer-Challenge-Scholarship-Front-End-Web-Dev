console.log is used to display content to the JavaScript console. Run the following code in the console:
///


console.log("hiya friend!");


///
Optional demo example
Let’s use console.log to do something a little more interesting.
Here’s a block of JavaScript code that loops through the numbers 0 through 9
and prints them out to the console:
///


for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
